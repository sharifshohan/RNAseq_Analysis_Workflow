# RNAseq_Analysis_Workflow
This code block contains easy steps to do a RNAseq analysis from count data. This includes doing differential expression and generating heatmap. It should also be noted that the some preprocessing including quality control steps have been omitted for simplicity in the code. Enjoy!
